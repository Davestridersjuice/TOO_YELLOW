## Stuff about me ·ìö·òè·ó¢

</div>

I'm usually sitting in ponytown with my friends <br>
 I've been trying to be nicer lately as i have been pretty rude so I'm working on that! <br>
 If I'm on pt not talking I'm either on Pinterest, Tiktok, Youtube, or Webtoon.. <br>
 I like to use emoticons lots! And I sometimes simplify/shorten words to type faster... <br>
'm usually very open with my weirdness so pls tell me if I ever make u uncomfy or anything! <br>
I may sometimes yap a bunch and move around a lot!<br>
I may say some really weird thing as a joke and not use /j... I only rlly use /srs or /hj <br>
 I REALLY like cats and the color purple... Purple is my fav color its so pretty <br>

 **‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èI may be a bit uneducated, slow, and annoying at times. If there's ever any problems whether I hurt your feelings, am annoying you, or just doing anything pls speak up!! It's better for me to know and learn than to not know and keep annoying you‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**
